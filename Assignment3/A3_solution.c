/* FILE: A3_solutions.c is where you will code your answers for Assignment 3.
 * 
 * Each of the functions below can be considered a start for you. They have 
 * the correct specification and are set up correctly with the header file to
 * be run by the tester programs.  
 *
 * You should leave all of the code as is, especially making sure not to change
 * any return types, function name, or argument lists, as this will break
 * the automated testing. 
 *
 * Your code should only go within the sections surrounded by
 * comments like "REPLACE EVERTHING FROM HERE... TO HERE.
 *
 * The assignment document and the header A3_solutions.h should help
 * to find out how to complete and test the functions. Good luck!
